   --> Simply put, a Spring interceptor is a class that either extends the HandlerInterceptorAdapter class or implements the HandlerInterceptor interface.

   --> The HandlerInterceptor contains three main methods:

         1) prehandle() – called before the execution of the actual handler
         2) postHandle() – called after the handler is executed
         3) afterCompletion() – called after the complete request is finished and the view is generated
            These three methods provide flexibility to do all kinds of pre- and post-processing.
